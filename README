The Viewable framework is a set of tools for application development in OpenLaszlo, adding concepts and classes that ease large development of large projects.

Under "framework" you'll find a set of .lzx files that make up the useful and importable parts of the framework into your own applications.

Under "examples" you find some limited uses of the framework (TBD)

Under "tests" are individual lax files meant to test the framework.
